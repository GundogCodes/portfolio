        <h1>A bit about me</h1>
        <article>
          I am a 24 year old aspiring software engineer from Canada! 
          I have completed a rigorous Software Engineering intensive program at General Assembly,
          where I honed my skills to become a versatile full-stack software engineer. 
          My passion for technology, problem-solving, creating cool things, and working with others drives my pursuit of a career in the dynamic and fast-paced tech development field.

        <h1>Scamazon</h1>
        Spearheaded a group project to develop an Amazon clone with user authentication, dynamic product listings, and order management functionalities.
        We utilized the Vite front-end framework in conjunction with React, which streamlined development and focus on performance optimization.
        We also integrated Git and Git branching techniques to their full extent! This helped facilitating efficient collaboration within a multi-developer version control.
        For the backend, we used Express, NodeJS, and Mongoose to architect a robust backend ecosystem!
        This marked my first time collaborating within a team on a single project, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I gained valuable insights into the entire process of information flow, from creating a data structure model to intercepting and manipulating data within controllers, and finally utilizing it on the frontend and vice versa. Additionally, I cherished the collaborative aspect of the project, where we divided tasks, shared ideas, and seamlessly merged our work.

        <h1>ProDesic</h1>
        Utilized a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js) to build a Reddit-like communication API with full CRUD capabilities, where users can add friends, engage in private messaging, and discuss topics within open forums.
        Implemented robust user authentication and data encryption mechanisms, incorporating industry-leading technologies such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Bcrypt. These security measures adhere to best practices, ensuring a high level of protection for user data and enhancing the overall system’s security.
        Integrated front-end frameworks such as Next.js to handle front-end routing and React to dynamically render views to the end user.
        Employed Mongoose to define schemas for every data type (Users, posts, forums, private messages) and deployed via AWS.

        <h1>Rick and Morty: Reality's Edge</h1>
        Used simple HTML, CSS, & Javascript to create a fully funcitonal web game with dynamic user input to control player, randomly generate enemies, and customize user abilities.
        Incorporated user input event-handlers that allowed players to shape the game’s outcome, enhancing replayability and engagement.
        Ensured a responsive and visually appealing user interface, utilizing CSS to adapt to various screen sizes and devices seamlessly.
        Demonstrated proficiency in front-end development, creative problem-solving, and the ability to build interactive experiences with music and user interaction.
        Integrated background music and sound effects that perfectly complemented the Rick and Morty theme, enhancing the game’s immersive experience.
