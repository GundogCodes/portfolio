          We utilized the Vite front-end framework in conjunction with React, which streamlined development and focus on performance optimization.
          We also integrated Git and Git branching techniques to their full extent! This helped facilitating efficient collaboration within a multi-developer version control.
          For the backend, we used Express, NodeJS, and Mongoose to architect a robust backend ecosystem!
          This marked my first time collaborating within a team on a single project, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I gained valuable insights into the entire process of information flow, from creating a data structure model to intercepting and manipulating data within controllers, and finally utilizing it on the frontend and vice versa. Additionally, I cherished the collaborative aspect of the project, where we divided tasks, shared ideas, and seamlessly merged our work.
